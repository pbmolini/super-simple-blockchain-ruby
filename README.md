# Super simple blockchain in Ruby

This code is the result of what I did following [this nice guide](https://github.com/yukimotopress/programming-blockchains-step-by-step/blob/master/manuscript/README.md), and it is meant mainly for myself.

## Installation
No installation. Just make sure to have gem `pp` (`gem install pp` if not).

## Create and print the blockchain
```bash
$ ruby main.rb
```

## Benchmark hash rate
```bash
$ ruby benchmark.rb
```
